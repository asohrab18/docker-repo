I uploaded 3 images as Repositories on my Docker Hub Account. PULL Commands are as:
docker pull asohrab18/spring-cloud-discovery-eureka-server
docker pull asohrab18/microservice-eureka-client-x
docker pull asohrab18/microservice-eureka-client-y

NOTE: microservice-eureka-client-y calls APIs of microservice-eureka-client-x using RestTemplate via EUREKA SERVER.

RELATED APIs URLs:

EUREKA SERVER:
http://localhost:8761

microservice-eureka-client-x:
http://localhost:8001/employees/all
http://localhost:8001/employees/id/1

microservice-eureka-client-y:
http://localhost:8002/information/employees
http://localhost:8002/information/employees/1


After pulling images at our local system (Docker), the docker-compose.yaml file can be executed by command in CMD Prompt(Windows OS): 
Command is "docker-compose up"Â
